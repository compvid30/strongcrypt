<A NAME="level_4_heading_1"><H4>Building the GUI</H4></A>


<P>
This is a description for Delphi newbies of the basic steps involved in
compiling the FreeOTFE GUI.
<P>
To build the GUI, the following software is required:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Delphi (CodeGear Delphi 2007 or later, though Delphi 2006 should just as well. Delphi v5 -
v7 can probably be used with minimal changes, though wouldn't look
as nice under Windows Vista)</li>
  <li>The SDeanComponents package (v2.00.00 or later)</li>
  <li>(Optional) GNU gettext for Delphi (dxgettext), available (free) from: <A HREF="http://dybdahl.dk/dxgettext/">http://dybdahl.dk/dxgettext/</A> (This package adds support for language translations)
</ul>
The binary release of this software was built with CodeGear Delphi 2007.<br>
<ol>
  <li>With each of the packages in the SDeanComponents archive,</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Build each package</li>
    <li>Install each package</li>
    <li>Ensure
that the correct path to each package is added to your Delphi
environment ("Tools | Environment Options...", "Library" tab)</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Add the path to the modified Delphi files included in SDeanComponents
to fix various bugs relating to Delphi 2006's Windows Vista support to
the top of Delphi's standard library paths. (This step probably won't
be needed with later versions of Delphi, and shouldn't be carried out
with older versions of Delphi, which will have different source)<li>Open the FreeOTFE project ("FreeOTFE.dpr")</li>
  <li>If you have the dxgettext software installed (see above), ensure that the compiler directive "_DXGETTEXT" is set. Otherwise, make sure that this compiler directive is <I>not</I> set.
  <li>Build the application.</li>
  <li>You should now find a file called "FreeOTFE.exe" in the directory
above the "src" directory
</ol>
You have now successfully built the GUI frontend!
<P>
If required, the compiler definition "FREEOTFE_TIME_CDB_DUMP" may be
set, in which case the time taken to dump a CDB ("Tools | Critical data
block | Dump to human readable file...") will be shown after the dump
completes.

<P>
<A NAME="level_4_heading_2"><H4>Building the Kernel Drivers</H4></A>


The kernel mode drivers implement the actual hash,
encryption/decryption and main FreeOTFE drivers.
<P>
To build these drivers, the following software is required:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (older versions may well be used, changing "vcvarsall" to "vcvars32", and similar changes)
<UL>
  <li>If using an older version of MS Visual Studio, the MS Windows SDK (February 2003 version) is also needed
</UL>
  <li>The MS Windows WDK (WDK for Server 2008 v6001.18001)
</ul>
The binary release of this software was built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition.
<P>
At time of writing, the MS Windows SDK can be downloaded from the
Microsoft WWW site. The MS Windows DDK is not available as a download,
but can be ordered from the Microsoft WWW site as a free CD, for the
cost of delivery.
<P>
It should be noted that if you are unable to source the exact versions
listed above, earlier versions may well be substituted, although I
cannot guarantee success. Later versions should operate correctly. The
above list describes the development environment as used to build the
binary release of FreeOTFE.<br>

<A NAME="level_5_heading_1"><H5>Setting up the Build Environment</H5></A>


<A NAME="level_6_heading_1"><H6>Installation and Configuration of MS Build Environment</H6></A>


The following list comprehensively describes the configuration used to
build the binary
release of FreeOTFE. Feel free to adjust according to taste - a number
of the options listed are not necessary, and are only included for
completeness...<br>
<ol>
  <li>Install VC++
  <li>Put a copy of "vcvarsall.bat" into one of the directories in your
path</li>
  <li>Configure the VC++ editor:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>To use spaces, not tabs</li>
    <li>To indent braces</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Install the MS Windows SDK with the following options:
  <ul>
    <li>Install in C:\MSSDK</li>
    <li>Install the "Core SDK"</li>
    <li><span style="font-style: italic;">Then</span> install the
debugging tools for windows</li>
    <li>Do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> register
environment variables (we'll use "Setenv.bat" from the command line)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Install the MS Windows DDK with the following options:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Install in C:\WINDDK\3790
    <li>Include the "Illustrative Driver Samples"</li>
    <li>Include the "Input Samples"</li>
    <li>Include the "Storage Samples"</li>
    <li>Include the "Virtual Device Driver Samples"</li>
    <li>Include the "WDM Samples"</li>

  <br>
  <li>Edit "setup_env_driver.bat" (in the same directory), and ensure
that "SETENV.BAT" is called with the parameters appropriate to the type
of build you wish to create, and that "FREEOTFE_OUTPUT_DIR" is set to
the appropriate directory under the source directories where the build executable
places the files it creates (this shouldn't be needed as it will happen automatically if the above are configured correctly)
</ol>

<A NAME="level_6_heading_3"><H6>3rd Party Source Code</H6></A>


Some of the FreeOTFE drivers (the hash/encryptions drivers in
particular) are dependant on certain 3rd party software being
installed. FreeOTFE's source code comes complete with 3rd party
included in the"src\3rd_party" directory and should be
preconfigured, ready for use.
<P>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Alternatively</span>,
you may wish to download this 3rd party source from the
original authors in order to verify the integrity of this software. For
this reason, details of where this software was obtained from are
included in the above directory.
<P>
Please note that should choose the latter option, it is important that
you review the individual driver notes (see separate driver
directories; "_notes.txt" files) to ensure that this software is
configured correctly. Additionally, you may well have to modify the
"my_build_sys.bat" files, directing them to the location where you
installed said 3rd party source code, as the build process requires
that certain files are copied over into the FreeOTFE src directories.
(Annoying, but this is a requirement of the MS "build.exe" command)
<P>
The LibTomCrypt source in particular had minor configuration changes to
tomcrypt_cfg.h and tomcrypt_custom.h; please compare the original
source (a copy of its release ZIP file is stored under
src\3rd_party\libtomcrypt) with the modified version (uncompressed in a
directory under this one)<br>

<A NAME="level_5_heading_2"><H5>Building the FreeOTFE Drivers</H5></A>


Either:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Open "FreeOTFE.sln" using Visual C++</li>
  <li>Rightclick on each project in turn, and select "Build"</li>
</ol>
or:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Enter each of the separate driver directories in turn and launch
each project's "my_build_sys.bat"</li>
</ol>
In either case, a copy of the binary which is built will be copied into
the directory above your "src" directory.
<P>
After reaching this stage, you should have successfully built your own
version of the FreeOTFE drivers!
<P>
Notes:<br>
<ol>
  <li>If FREEOTFE_TARGET is set to W2K, the resulting binary may
not
operate correctly under MS Windows XP as a number of functions what are
only needed under Windows XP and later are #ifdef'd out. As a result, a
"W2K" binary may not operate correctly under Windows XP (e.g. trying to
format a volume
may result in... Nothing happening). If you want a binary which will
operate under <span style="font-style: italic;">both</span> Windows 2000 and Windows XP, set this to WXP.</li>
  <li>Windows
XP migrated a couple of the previous Windows 2000 macros
to be functions. In order to allow the above "WXP" builds to work under
Windows 2000, "IFSRelated.h" includes a copy of these macros, and uses
them regardless - see comments in code for an explanation.</li>
</ol>

<A NAME="level_3_heading_5"><H3>Signing the Binaries</H3></A>


To sign the FreeOTFE binary files (.exe, .dll and .sys files), the procedure is pretty much as described at: <A 

HREF="http://www.pantaray.com/signcode.html#create_SPC">Pantaray Research</A> WWW site

<P>
At present, FreeOTFE is signed using a self-signed certificate; the full procedure used is as follows:

<OL>
<LI>Install Visual Studio
<LI>From a command prompt, run "vcvarsall" (all commands detailed below should be executed from this command prompt)
<LI>Create a private certificate:

<blockquote>
<pre>
makecert.exe -sv sdean12.pvk -n "E=sdean12@sdean12.org,CN=Sarah Dean" sdean12.cer
</pre>
</blockquote>

this should create two files: sdean12.pvk and sdean12.cer

<LI>Create a test software publisher certificate (SPC):
<blockquote>
<pre>
cert2spc.exe sdean12.cer sdean12.spc
</pre>
</blockquote>
to create sdean12.spc. (This file would normally be supplied by a CA, if purchased)

<LI>Create a personal information file:
<blockquote>
<pre>
pvk2pfx -pvk sdean12.pvk -spc sdean12.spc -pfx sdean12.pfx -f /pi <I>&lt;pvk password&gt;</I> /po <I>&lt;pfx password&gt;</I>
</pre>
</blockquote>

Where:
<UL>
<LI><I>&lt;pvk password&gt;</I> is the password used when generating the .pvk file with makecert.txt
<LI><I>&lt;pfx password&gt;</I> is the password you wish to use for securing the new .pfx file
</UL>

<LI>Sign each of binary files:
<blockquote>
<pre>
signtool.exe sign /f sdean12.pfx /p <I>&lt;pfx password&gt;</I> /v /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll <I>&lt;filename&gt;</I> 
</pre>
</blockquote>

Where:
<UL>
<LI><I>&lt;pfx password&gt;</I> is the password used when generating the .pfx file with pvk2pfx
</UL>

<P>
The URL specified is a time stamping service (Verisign's in this case).
</OL>

<P>
<HR class="half"> <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<A NAME="level_3_heading_6"><H3>Additional Notes</H3></A>


When building the C code, FreeOTFEPlatform.h automatically #defines one of the following:

<UL>
<LI>FreeOTFE_PC_DRIVER
<LI>FreeOTFE_PC_DLL
<LI>FreeOTFE_PDA
</UL>
